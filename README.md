# 2-BIT-BCD-COUNTER
The 2-Bit BCD Counter project implements a Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) counter using Verilog HDL. This counter cycles through a sequence of BCD values (0 to 2) and resets to 0 upon reaching the maximum count, ensuring compliance with the BCD format. The RTL code includes a synchronous reset, initializing the counter to 0, and a clock signal for sequential operation. A detailed testbench is provided to verify the functionality of the BCD counter. The testbench generates clock and reset signals, monitors the output, and validates the counter's behavior against expected results.
